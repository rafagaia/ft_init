# Make the intra.42.fr address reroute to 46.19.122.85

# We do this by adding a new entry to /etc/hosts, which needs sudo permissions
# if we had it, we would write the following entry on last line of the file:

"intra.42.fr	46.19.122.85"

Then, doing cat /etc/hosts would yield:
cat /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1       localhost
255.255.255.255 broadcasthost
::1             localhost
intra.42.fr     46.19.122.85
#10.51.1.38 	cdn.intra.42.fr
